I'm surprised nobody's posted one before.  I pieced this one together from modified bits of the Lava Spawn missile, Orb of Corruption missile, and Healing Spray missile.<br />
<br />
There weren't really any sounds in WC3 that matched the sound of Arcane Missiles very well, but I did my best.  Suggestions for alternatives are welcome.<br />
